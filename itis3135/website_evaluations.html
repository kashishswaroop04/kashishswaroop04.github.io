    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple makes key information simple to view and understand by using a sharp contrast with clean backgrounds and clear fonts.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The website keeps a clean and seamless look by using the same fonts, colors, and layout style throughout all pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The page's content is perfectly spaced and aligned, giving the website a feeling of order and visual balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Clear groups of related information make it easier for visitors to quickly figure out what information belongs together.</li>
    </ul>

    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website's text and background colors are not well separated, making it difficult to read the material.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There not much consistency in fonts, colors, and layout, which makes the site feel super outdated and unorganized.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> A lot of elements are badly aligned, giving the page a messy and confusing appearance.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is not grouped well, making it difficult to tell which information belongs together.</li>
    </ul>

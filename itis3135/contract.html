    <h2>Course Contract</h2>

    <p>
        I, <em>Kashish Swaroop</em>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my
        <em>Fall 2026</em>, <em>ITIS 3135</em>, <em>Front-End Web Development</em>
        with my instructor, <em>Professor D.I. von Briesen</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available
        to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork,
        or that I wish to keep private.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up
        for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
    </p>

    <p>
        I understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many
        examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use
        these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly
        given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
    </p>
